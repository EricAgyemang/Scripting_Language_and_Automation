A zero trust architecture (ZTA) uses zero trust principles to plan enterprise infrastructure and workflows. Zero trust assumes there is no implicit trust granted to assets or user accounts based solely on their physical or network location (i.e., local area networks versus the internet). Authentication and authorization (both user and device) are discrete functions performed before a session to an enterprise resource is established. Zero trust is a response to enterprise network trends that include remote users and cloud-based assets that are not located within an enterprise-owned network boundary. Zero trust focus on protecting resources, not network segments, as the network location is no longer seen as the prime component to the security posture of the resource. This document contains an abstract definition of zero trust architecture (ZTA) and gives general deployment models and use cases where zero trust could improve an enterprise’s overall information technology security posture.\""],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"eTxFuIcCfkA7","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1635914466134,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":159,"user":{"displayName":"Yongning Tang","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s64","userId":"15267084954923866581"}},"outputId":"9adaa8f1-692f-45e5-99e6-2c04b7e5c271"},"source":["from collections import Counter\n","\n","wordcount = Counter()\n","#wordcount.update( open(“anycontent.txt”).read().lower().split() )\n","wordcount.update( anycontentStr.lower().split() )\n","wordcount.most_common(10)\n"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["[('trust', 9),\n"," ('zero', 8),\n"," ('and', 7),\n"," ('the', 6),\n"," ('network', 6),\n"," ('to', 6),\n"," ('is', 5),\n"," ('an', 5),\n"," ('of', 3),\n"," ('that', 3)]"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":4}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"6RrLgfUSkLtP","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1635914470410,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":119,"user":{"displayName":"Yongning Tang","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s64","userId":"15267084954923866581"}},"outputId":"fa1e4f3b-bb15-4c24-ce0d-2503f01645fa"},"source":["wordcount['trust']\n","wordcount.update(['trust', 'trust'])\n","wordcount['trust']\n","wordcount.subtract(['trust'])\n","wordcount['trust']"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["10"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":5}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"e_HGKXHH3Dni"},"source":["Some common Regular Expression rules - using https://pythex.org/ to test:\n","\n","* clientIP\n","* timestamp\n","* action\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"68Mzy5OYrk73"},"source":["import re\n","from collections import Counter\n","\n","#logstr = '109.169.248.247 - - [12/Dec/2015:18:25:11 +0100] \"GET /administrator/ HTTP/1.1\" 200 4263 \"-\" \"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.0; rv:34.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/34.0\" \"-\"'\n","\n","regexp = re.compile(\n","    r'(?P<clientIP>\\d{1,3}\\.\\d{1,3}\\.\\d{1,3}\\.\\d{1,3}).+\\['\n","    + '(?P<timestamp>\\d{2}/[A-Z][a-z]{2}/\\d\\d\\d\\d).+\\\"'\n","    + '(?P<action>[A-Z]{3,4})'\n","    )\n","\n","cnt_clientIPs = Counter()\n","\n","f = open('access-sample.log', 'r')\n","matched = 0\n","failed = 0\n","for line in f:\n","    m = re.match(regexp, line)\n","    if m:\n","        cnt_clientIPs.update([m.group('clientIP')])\n","        matched += 1\n","    else:\n","        failed += 1\n","\n","    print(\"\"\"\\\n","client .........: %s\n","timestamp ......: %s\n","action .........: %s\n","\"\"\" % ( m.group('clientIP'),\n","        m.group('timestamp'),\n","        m.group('action'),\n","    ))\n","\n","print('[*] %d lines matched the regular expression' % (matched))\n","print('[*] %d lines failed to match the regular expression' % (failed), end='\\n\\n')\n","print('[*] ============================================')\n","print('[*] 10 Most Frequently Occurring Clients Queried')\n","print('[*] ============================================')\n","\n","for clientIP, count in cnt_clientIPs.most_common(10):\n","    print('[*] %30s: %d' % (clientIP, count))\n","print('[*] ============================================')\n"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
