The most common data types in Python are listed below. The values -2 and 30, for example, are said to be **integer** values. The integer (or int) data type indicates values that are whole numbers. Numbers with a decimal point, such as 3.14, are called floating-point numbers (or **floats**). Note that even though the value 42 is an integer, the value 42.0 would be a floating-point number. Python programs can also have text values called **strings**, or strs (pronounced “stirs”). Always surround your string in single quote (') characters (as in 'Hello' or 'Goodbye cruel world!') so Python knows where the string begins and ends. You can even have a string with no characters in it, '', called a blank string. \n","\n","Built-in data types and their values:\n","*  integer (int): 2. 3. 5\n","*  float: 3.14\n","*  string (str): 'abc', \"abc\"'\n","*  boolean: True, False\n","\n","Integers in Python have unlimited size, which means you can create any huge integer number as you need. Python also supports hexademimal, octal, and binary data, which can be expressed as below:\n","*  hexadecimal: 0x2ab\n","*  octal: 0o277\n","*  binary: 0b1010\n","\n","Floating-point numbers (floats) are natively double precision (64 bits), which is the same implementation of double in C programming language. Some Python library such as NumPy can suppor 128-bit precision. \n","\n","Other built-in data types as shown below are often referred to as data structures, which we will discuss later.\n","*  list\n","*  tuple\n","*  set\n","*  dictionary\n","\n","\n","In Python, everything is implemented as an object, including booleans, integers, floats, strings, even large data structures, functions, and programs. This gives the language a consistency (and useful features) that some other languages lack.\n","\n","An object is like a storage box that contains a piece of data. The object has a type, such as boolean or integer, that determines what can be done with the data.
