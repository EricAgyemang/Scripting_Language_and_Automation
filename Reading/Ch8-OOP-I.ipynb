You can write a Python script to automate a task, or develop some traditional applications using Python as a procedural programming language (like Fortran, COBOL, BASIC, and C), or more likely build some modern applications using Python as an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) tool.\n","\n","The focus of procedural programming is to break down a programming task into a collection of variables, data structures, and subroutines or functions, whereas in object-oriented programming it is to break down a programming task into objects that expose **behavior** (methods) and **attributes** (data, members or fields) using interfaces. The most important distinction is that while procedural programming uses procedures to operate on data structures, object-oriented programming bundles the two together. So an object, which is an instance of a class, operates on its own data structure.["]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ABeGor7KpM39"},"source":["Object-oriented programming is one of the most effective approaches to develop software. In object-oriented programming you write classes that represent real-world things and situations, and you create objects based on these classes. When you write a class, you define the general behavior that a whole category of objects can have. When you create individual objects from the class, each object is automatically equipped with the general behavior; you can then give each object whatever unique traits you desire. You’ll be amazed how well real-world situations can be modeled with object-oriented programming.\n","\n","Everything in Python, from numbers to data structures, is an object. However, Python sometimes hides the apparenence of objects by means of special syntax. You can type ```num = 7``` to create an object of type integer with the value ```7```, and assign an object reference to the name ```num```.
