Knowledge Points of Ch5 "Dictionaries and Structuring Data"
1. A dictionary is typed with braces {}. Each item in a dictionary is a key-value pair, where "key" functions as the index to access its associated value. 
2. An empty dictionary without any items is written with just two curly braces, like this: {}. 
3. Keys should be unique within a dictionary while values may not be. The values of a dictionary can be of any type, but the keys must be of an immutable data type such as strings, numbers, or tuples.
4. Unlike lists, items in dictionaries are unordered.  Because dictionaries are not ordered, they canâ€™t be sliced like lists.
5. The keys(), values(), and items() Methods. 
6. Checking Whether a Key or Value Exists in a Dictionary using "in" and "not in".
7. The get() Method
8. Nested Dictionaries and Lists
