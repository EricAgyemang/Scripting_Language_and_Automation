In those languages, it’s good practice to use consistent indentation to make your program more readable for yourself and others. There are even tools to make your code line up nicely.\n","\n","When he was designing the language that became Python, Guido van Rossum decided that the indentation itself was enough to define a program’s structure, and avoided typing all those parentheses and curly braces. Python is unusual in this use of white space to define program structure. It’s one of the first aspects that newcomers notice, and it can seem odd to those who have experience with other languages. It turns out that after writing Python for a little while, you will get used to doing more while typing less, and very likely start enjoying it.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"HtiG0E-eLblX","colab_type":"text"},"source":["###Comment with $#$\n","\n","A comment is a piece of text in your program that is ignored by the Python interpreter.

When you’re about to write some Python code, it’s often worthwhile to first check whether there’s a standard module that already does what you want. It’s surprising how often you encounter little gems in the standard library. Python also provides authoritative documentation for the modules, along with a tutorial. Doug Hellmann’s website Python Module of the Week and his book The Python Standard Library by Example (Addison-Wesley Professional) are also very useful guides.\n","\n","In the standard library, many of the standard modules are specific to the Web, systems, databases, and so on.
