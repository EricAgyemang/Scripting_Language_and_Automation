If you think of those as atoms, the data structures in this chapter are like molecules. That is, we combine those basic types in more complex ways. You will use these every day.\n","\n","This chapter introduces a new concept: data structures. A data structure is a collection of data elements (such as numbers or characters, or even other data structures) that is structured in some way, such as by numbering the elements. The most basic data structure in Python is the **sequence** (e.g., string, list and tuple). Each element of a sequence is assigned a number — its position, or index. The first index is zero, the second index is one, and so forth. Some programming languages number their sequence elements starting with one, but the zero-indexing convention has a natural interpretation of an offset from the beginning of the sequence, with negative indexes wrapping around to the end. \n","\n","This chapter begins with an overview of sequences and then covers some operations that are common to all sequences, including lists, tuples and sets. These operations will also work with strings, which will be used in some of the examples, although for a full treatment of string operations, you have to wait until the next chapter. After dealing with these basics, we start working with lists and see what’s special about them. And after lists, we come to tuples, a special-purpose type of sequence similar to lists, except that you can’t change them."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"EafvLBMF78mO"},"source":["Python has several built-in types of sequences. This chapter concentrates on two of the most common ones: lists and tuples. Strings are another important type, which we will also briefly discuss here.\n","\n","The main difference between lists and tuples is that you can change a list, but you can’t change a tuple. This means a list might be useful if you need to add elements as you go along, while a tuple can be useful if, for some reason, you can’t allow the sequence to change. Reasons for the latter are usually rather technical, having to do with how things work internally in Python. That’s why you may see built-in functions returning tuples. For your own programs, chances are you can use lists instead of tuples in almost all circumstances. (One notable exception is using tuples as dictionary keys. There lists aren’t allowed, because you aren’t allowed to modify keys.)\n","\n","Sequences are useful when you want to work with a collection of values. You might have a sequence representing students in a database, with the first element being their names and the second their grades.
