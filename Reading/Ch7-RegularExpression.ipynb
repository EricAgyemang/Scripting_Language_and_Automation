For example, we need find any or all phone numbers, or IP addresses, or emails from a given text. So the challenge here is how we should describe what we want to search, which is so called \"**pattern**\".\n","\n","Let's start from a relativly easier example: find a north American phone number, such as 309-438-8000. Here, we simply assume all phone numbers start with three digits (i.e., area code), followed by a hyphen \"-\", and another three digits, followed by another hyphon, and then followed by last four digits. Such a description about what a phone number looks like is actually a definition of a pattern. \n","\n","Apparently, finding infomation matching a pattern from a given string is much more challenging than finding an exactly matched substring. We need develop a specific pattern matching algorithm for such a task. Please note, developing such an algorithm has nothing to do with Python. We can implement an algorithm by different programming languages. Of course, we will use Python here.\n","\n","###How shall we develop an algorithm? \n","\n","An algorithm is simply the steps (just like a recipe for cooking) to solve a problem. But how to find these steps? This is one of the most critical skills every professional must grasp. \n","\n","There is no formula we can always follow to find such a solution. However, there are some good approaches or methods we can follow. One of them is called \"Divid-and-Conquer\". This divide-and-conquer technique is the basis of efficient algorithms for all kinds of problems, such as sorting (e.g., quicksort), pattern matching, and syntactic analysis (e.g., top-down parsers), etc.\n","\n","####Divide and Conquer\n","\n","In computer science, divide and conquer is an algorithm design paradigm based on multi-branched recursion. A divide-and-conquer approach works by recursively breaking down a problem into two or more sub-problems of the same or related type, until these become simple enough to be solved directly. The solutions to the sub-problems are then combined to give a solution to the original problem.\n","\n","Understanding and designing divide-and-conquer algorithms is a complex skill that requires a good understanding of the nature of the underlying problem to be solved. It is often necessary to replace the original problem with a more general or complicated problem in order to initialize the recursion, and there is no systematic method for finding the proper generalization. The good news is for many problems like finding a phone number, our intuition is usually sufficient for tackling such a challenge.

Matching\n","\n","Using regular expression, we may define a pattern that can be matched in different ways in a strong. \n","\n","* Greedy: As Many As Possible (longest match)\n","\n","By default, a regex quantifier (e.g., \\*) tells the regex engine to match as many instances of its quantified token or subpattern as possible. This behavior is called **greedy**.\n","\n","For instance, take the + quantifier. It allows the engine to match one or more of the token it quantifies: \\d+ can therefore match one or more digits. But \"one or more\" is rather vague: in the string 123, \"one or more digits\" (starting from the left) could be 1, 12 or 123. Which of these does \\d+ match?\n","\n","Because by default quantifiers are greedy, \\d+ matches as many digits as possible, i.e. 123. For the match attempt that starts at a given position, a greedy quantifier gives you the longest match.\n","\n","* Lazy: As Few As Possible (shortest match)\n","\n","In contrast to the standard greedy quantifier, which eats up as many instances of the quantified token as possible, a **lazy** (sometimes called Non-greedy or reluctant) quantifier tells the engine to match as few of the quantified tokens as needed. A regular quantifier is made lazy by appending a ? question mark to it.\n","\n","Since the * quantifier allows the engine to match zero or more characters, \\w*?E tells the engine to match zero or more word characters, but as few as needed—which might be none at all — then to match an E. In the string 123EEE, starting from the very left, \"zero or more word characters then an E\" could be 123E, 123EE or 123EEE. Which of these does \\w*?E match?\n","\n","Because the *? quantifier is lazy, \\w*? matches as few characters as possible to allow the overall match attempt to succeed, i.e. 123 — and the overall match is 123E. For the match attempt that starts at a given position, a lazy quantifier gives you the shortest match.\n","\n","Let's look at an example:"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"LSyT4pnr9-0Z","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":50},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1584999859330,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":352,"user":{"displayName":"Yongning Tang","photoUrl":"","userId":"15267084954923866581"}},"outputId":"c31d9979-7785-4556-ed03-2da69e0ce838"},"source":["import re\n","\n","htmlHead  = '<h1>TITLE</h1>'\n","result1 = re.search(r'<.*>', htmlHead)\n","print(result1.group())\n","result2 = re.search(r'<.*?>', htmlHead)\n","print(result2.group())"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["<h1>TITLE</h1>\n","<h1>\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"LW9csgzcJf0e"},"source":[""]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"QHHtLLfRWio4","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":50},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1584999966145,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":321,"user":{"displayName":"Yongning Tang","photoUrl":"","userId":"15267084954923866581"}},"outputId":"d81e7658-a045-4176-c101-89f831d723e8"},"source":["import re\n","\n","str  = 'hahahahaha'\n","result1 = re.search(r'(ha){1,5}', str)\n","print(result1.group())\n","result2 = re.search(r'(ha){1,5}?', str)\n","print(result2.group())"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["hahahahaha\n","ha\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"9BZdM8S0HbPN","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":50},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1585079866163,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":414,"user":{"displayName":"Yongning Tang","photoUrl":"","userId":"15267084954923866581"}},"outputId":"1a6b8aa6-68c5-469d-bbe4-31dbde5c3fe7"},"source":["import re\n","\n","str  = 'hahaha something else in the middle haha'\n","result1 = re.search(r'(ha).*(ha)', str)\n","print(result1.group())\n","result2 = re.search(r'(ha).*?(ha)', str)\n","print(result2.group())"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["hahaha something else in the middle haha\n","haha\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Sq3Az_JP5WQt"},"source":["##Developing a Regular Expression \n","\n","In many applications, we need identify or valide users' emails.
