Knowledge Points of Ch3 "Functions"
1. A function is like a mini-program within a program.
2. A def statement is used to define a function, e.g., def myFunc(): 
3. The function code is executed when a function is called, not when the function is first defined.
4. A function call is just the functionâ€™s name followed by parentheses, possibly with some number of arguments in between the parentheses.
5. When the program execution reaches a function call, it will jump to the top line in the function and begin executing the code there. When it reaches the end of the function, the execution returns to the line that called the function and continues moving through the code as before.
6. A major purpose of functions is to efficiently reuse codes.
7. def Statements with Parameters, e.g., def myFunc(parameters):  
   Please note: the parameters are only visible/accessible within the function, so-called local variables. 
8. Return Values and return Statements
