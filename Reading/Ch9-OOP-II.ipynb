This concept is also known as DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).\n","\n","In Python, the concept of OOP follows some basic principles (often called **PIE**). In this section, we will only study **inheritance**. \n","\n","| PIE Perperties | WHAT IT Means |\n","| --- | --- |\n","| Inheritance | A process of using details from a new class without modifying existing class. |\n","| Encapsulation | Hiding the private details of a class from other objects. |\n","| Polymorphism | A concept of using common operation in different ways for different data input. |\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Vm8MhGhOxUTi","colab_type":"text"},"source":["##Inheritance\n","\n","One of the major benefits of object oriented programming is reuse of code and one of the ways this is achieved is through the inheritance mechanism. Inheritance is a way of creating new class for using details of existing class without modifying it. The newly formed class is a derived class (or child class). Similarly, the existing class is a base class (or parent class). Inheritance can be best imagined as implementing a type and subtype relationship between classes.\n","\n","Suppose you want to write a program which has to keep track of the **teachers** and **students** in a college. They have some *common* characteristics such as name, age and address. They also have *specific* characteristics such as salary, courses and leaves for teachers and, marks and fees for students.\n","\n","You can create two independent classes for each type and process them but adding a new common characteristic would mean adding to both of these independent classes. This quickly becomes unwieldy.\n","\n","A better way would be to create a common class called **SchoolMember** and then have the teacher and student classes inherit from this class, i.e. they will become sub-types of this type (class) and then we can add specific characteristics to these sub-types.\n","\n","There are many advantages to this approach. If we add/change any functionality in SchoolMember, this is automatically reflected in the subtypes/subclasses as well. For example, you can add a new ID card field for both teachers and students by simply adding it to the SchoolMember class. However, changes in the subtypes do not affect other subtypes. Another advantage is that you can refer to a teacher or student object as a SchoolMember object which could be useful in some situations such as counting of the number of school members. This is called polymorphism where a sub-type can be substituted in any situation where a parent type is expected, i.e. the object can be treated as an instance of the parent class.\n","\n","Also observe that we reuse the code of the parent class and we do not need to repeat it in the different classes as we would have had to in case we had used independent classes.\n","\n","The SchoolMember class in this situation is known as the base class or the superclass. The Teacher and Student classes are called the derived classes or subclasses.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"DNgUqRIqxcVp","colab_type":"code","outputId":"17a91017-7bf7-4b6c-a827-961eee195370","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1586284934492,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":463,"user":{"displayName":"Yongning Tang","photoUrl":"","userId":"15267084954923866581"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":168}},"source":["class SchoolMember:\n","    '''Represents any school member.'''\n","    def __init__(self, name, age):\n","        self.name = name\n","        self.age = age\n","        print('(Initialized SchoolMember: {})'.format(self.name))\n","\n","    def tell(self):\n","        '''Tell my details.'''\n","        print('Name:\"{}\" Age:\"{}\"'.format(self.name, self.age), end=\" \")\n","\n","\n","class Teacher(SchoolMember):\n","    '''Represents a teacher.'''\n","    def __init__(self, name, age, salary):\n","        SchoolMember.__init__(self, name, age)\n","        self.salary = salary\n","        print('(Initialized Teacher: {})'.format(self.name))\n","\n","    def tell(self):\n","        SchoolMember.tell(self)\n","        print('Salary: \"{:d}\"'.format(self.salary))\n","\n","\n","class Student(SchoolMember):\n","    '''Represents a student.'''\n","    def __init__(self, name, age, marks):\n","        SchoolMember.__init__(self, name, age)\n","        self.marks = marks\n","        print('(Initialized Student: {})'.format(self.name))\n","\n","    def tell(self):\n","        SchoolMember.tell(self)\n","        print('Marks: \"{:d}\"'.format(self.marks))\n","        \n","class Staff(SchoolMember):\n","  def __init__(self, name, age, office):\n","    SchoolMember.__init__(self, name, age)\n","    self.office = office\n","\n","  def tellOffice(self):\n","    print('(Initialized Staff: {})'.format(self.office))\n","    \n","\n","t = Teacher('Mr. Eric', 40, 30000)\n","s = Student('Alice', 25, 75)\n","staff = Staff(\"bob\", 20, 2009)\n","\n","# prints a blank line\n","print()\n","\n","members = [t, s, staff]\n","for member in members:\n","    # Works for both Teachers and Students\n","    member.tell()"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["(Initialized SchoolMember: Mr. Eric)\n","(Initialized Teacher: Mr. Eric)\n","(Initialized SchoolMember: Alice)\n","(Initialized Student: Alice)\n","(Initialized SchoolMember: bob)\n","\n","Name:\"Mr. Eric\" Age:\"40\" Salary: \"30000\"\n","Name:\"Alice\" Age:\"25\" Marks: \"75\"\n","Name:\"bob\" Age:\"20\" "],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Hyf8YyjN-Tyr","colab_type":"text"},"source":["In addition to use ```SchoolMember``` explicitely to call its ```__init__()``` method, we can also use ```super()``` function before ```__init__()``` method as the example code below.
