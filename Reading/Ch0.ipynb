Absolutely yes, as long as you know how to communicate with your computers. \n","\n","Communication can be conducted at different levels: basic, medium, or advanced. \n","\n","We are actually communicating with computers every day at a basic level via an operating system (OS) of a computer, as discussed later in this chapter. Things like reading your email, sharing your recipe on Facebook, searching for the greatest gift for your best friend, are all examples of communication that occurs between a computer and you. The OS is similar like a pre-built and installed housekeep in a computer, who manages all computer hardware and software resources, and is responsible for handling communication to an user though a well-designed graphic or command line user interface. The communication is claimed to be basic because an user can only use a fixed set of commands/instructions. \n","\n","Talking directly to a machine is an advanced communication option, and may seem quite odd at first. Having a conversation with your computer might sound like the script of a science fiction movie. After all, the members of the Enterprise on Star Trek regularly talked with their computer. In fact, the computer often talked back. However, with the rise of Apple’s Siri (http://www.apple.com/ios/siri/), Amazon’s Echo (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00X4WHP5E/), and other interactive software, perhaps you really don’t find a conversation so unbelievable.\n","\n","Asking the computer for information or doing pre-defined tasks is one thing, but providing it with your own instructions is quite another.

A modern computer system consists of **hardware** and **software**. Hardware consists of the physical devices required to execute algorithms. Software is the set of these algorithms, represented as programs in particular programming languages. In\n","the discussion that follows, we focus on the hardware and software found in a typical desktop computer system, although similar components are also found in other computer systems, such as smart phones.\n","\n","\n","---\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"yrJKEz2gI_kB"},"source":["###Computer Hardware\n","\n","The basic hardware components of a computer are memory, a central processing unit (CPU), and a set of input/output devices, as shown in the figure below.\n","<div>\n","<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=16lRYLPsq66PcvdCKfzg5-zb0es4LtQou\" width=\"500\"/>\n","</div>\n","\n","Human users primarily interact with the input and output devices. The input devices include a keyboard, a mouse, and a microphone. Common output devices include a monitor and speakers. Computers can also communicate with the external world through various ports that connect them to networks and to other devices such as handheld music players and digital cameras. The purpose of most of the input devices is to convert information that human beings deal with, such as text, images, and sounds, into information for computational processing. The purpose of most output devices is to convert the results of this processing back to human-usable form.\n","\n","Computer memory is set up to represent and store information in electronic form. Specifically, information is stored as patterns of binary digits (1s and 0s). We can represent any information, including text, images, and sound, in binary form. The  memory is also sometimes called primary or internal or random access memory (RAM).\n","\n","The information stored in memory can represent any type of data, such as numbers, text, images, or sound, or the instructions of a program. We can also store in memory an algorithm encoded as binary instructions for the computer. Once the information is stored in memory, we typically want to do something with it—that is, we want to process it. The part of a computer that is responsible for processing data is the central processing unit (CPU). This device, which is also sometimes called a processor, consists of electronic switches arranged to perform simple logical, arithmetic, and control operations. The CPU executes an algorithm by fetching its binary instructions from memory, decoding them, and executing them. Executing an instruction might involve fetching other binary\n","information—the data—from memory as well.\n","\n","The processor can locate data in a computer’s primary memory very quickly. However, these data exist only as long as electric power comes into the computer. If the power fails or is turned off, the data in primary memory are lost. Clearly, a more permanent type of memory is needed to preserve data. This more permanent type of memory is called external or secondary memory, and it comes in\n","several forms. Magnetic storage media, such as tapes and hard disks, allow bit patterns to be stored as patterns on a magnetic field. Semiconductor storage media, such as flash memory sticks, perform much the same function with a different technology, as do optical storage media, such as CDs and DVDs. Some of these secondary storage media can hold much larger quantities of information than the internal memory of a computer.\n","\n","\n","\n","---\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"rb1yrKykLCep"},"source":["###Computer Software\n","\n","You have learned that a computer is a general-purpose, problem-solving machine. To solve any computable problem, a computer must be capable of executing any algorithm (i.e., the steps to solve a computable problem). Because it is impossible to anticipate all of the problems for which there are algorithmic solutions, there is no way to “hardcode” all potential algorithms into a computer’s hardware. Instead, we build some basic operations into the hardware’s processor and require any algorithm to use them. The algorithms are converted to binary form and then loaded, with their data, into the computer’s memory. The processor can then execute the algorithms’ instructions by\n","running the hardware’s more basic operations.\n","\n","Any programs that are stored in memory so that they can be executed later are called software. A program stored in computer memory must be represented in binary digits, which is also known as machine code. Loading machine code into computer memory one digit at a time would be a tedious, error-prone task for human beings. It would be convenient if we could automate this process to get it right every time. For this reason, computer scientists have developed another program, called a **loader**, to perform this task. A loader takes a set of machine language instructions as input and loads them into the appropriate memory locations. When the loader is finished, the machine language program is ready to execute. Obviously, the loader cannot load itself into memory, so this is one of those algorithms that must be hardwired into the computer.\n","\n","Now that a loader exists, we can load and execute other programs that make the development, execution, and management of programs easier. This type of software is called **system software**. The most important example of system software is a computer’s **operating system**. \n","\n","\n","---\n","\n","\n","\n","You are probably already familiar with at least one of the most popular operating systems, such as Linux, Apple’s Mac OS, and Microsoft Windows. An operating system is responsible for managing and scheduling several concurrently running programs. It also manages the computer’s memory, including the external storage, and manages communications between the CPU, the input/output devices, and other computers on a network. An important part of any operating system is its file system, which allows human users to organize their data and programs in permanent storage. Another important function of an operating system is to provide user interfaces—that is, ways for the human user to interact with the computer’s software. A terminal-based interface accepts inputs from a keyboard and displays text output on a monitor screen. A modern graphical user interface (GUI) organizes the monitor screen around the metaphor of a desktop, with windows containing icons for folders, files, and applications. This type of user interface also allows the user to manipulate images with a pointing device such as a mouse.\n","\n","\n","---\n","\n","\n","Another major type of software is called applications software, or simply **applications**. An application is a program that is designed for a specific task, such as editing a document or displaying a Web page. Applications include Web browsers, word processors, spreadsheets, database managers, graphic design packages, music production systems, and games, among many others. As you begin to learn to write computer programs, you will focus on writing simple applications.\n","\n","As you have learned, computer hardware can execute only instructions that are written in binary form—that is, in machine language. Writing a machine language program, however, would be an extremely tedious, error-prone task. To ease the process of writing computer programs, computer scientists have developed high-level programming languages for expressing algorithms. These languages resemble English and allow the author to express algorithms in a form that other people can understand.\n","\n","A programmer typically starts by writing high-level language statements in a text editor. The programmer then runs another program called a translator to convert the high-level program code into executable code. Because it is possible for a programmer to make grammatical mistakes even when writing high-level code, the translator checks for syntax errors before it completes the translation process. If it detects any of these errors, the translator alerts the programmer via error messages. The programmer then has to revise the program. If the translation process succeeds without a syntax error, the program can be executed by the\n","run-time system. The run-time system might execute the program directly on the hardware or run yet another program called an interpreter or virtual machine to execute the program. \n","\n","\n","---\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Xl-kPatUVO2y"},"source":["##What is an computer application?\n","Computer applications provide the means to define express human ideas in a manner that a computer can understand.
