Your Python programs can output data to a text file, a procedure explained later in this section. The data in a text file can be viewed as characters, words, numbers, or lines of text, depending on the text file’s format and on the purposes for which the data are used. When the data are treated as numbers (either integers or floating-points), they must be separated by whitespace characters — spaces, tabs, and newlines.

In Python, we can easily implement such a functionality using a module called **pickle**. Technically, everything (including all data structures) in Pythin is object. The process of moving a Python object (e.g., sending to network or saving to files) is calle object serialization.\n","\n","###What is pickle?\n","Pickle is a Python module used for serializing and de-serializing Python object structures, also called marshalling or flattening. Serialization refers to the process of converting an object in memory to a byte stream that can be stored on disk or sent over a network. Later on, this character stream can then be retrieved and de-serialized back to a Python object. \n","\n","Don't confuse yourself between pickling and compression. The former is the conversion of an object from one representation (data in Random Access Memory (RAM)) to another (text on disk), while the latter is the process of encoding data with fewer bits, in order to save disk space.\n","\n","###What Can You Do With pickle?\n","Pickling is useful for applications where you need keep data or information persistency. For example, your program's state data can be saved to disk, so you can continue working on it later on. It can also be used to send data over a network using some transmission protocol such as Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), or to store Python objects in a database. \n","\n","Pickle is very useful for when you're working with machine learning algorithms, where you want to save them to be able to make new predictions at a later time, without having to rewrite everything or train the model all over again.\n","\n","Serilized objects via pickle cannot be guaranteed readable using a different programming language. The same holds for different versions of Python itself. Unpickling a file that was pickled in a different version of Python may not always work properly.

It's a lightweight format for data-interchange, that is easily readable by humans. Although it was derived from JavaScript, JSON is standardized and language-independent. This is a much desirable advantage over pickle. It's also more secure and much faster than pickle.\n","\n","However, if you only need to use Python, then the pickle module is still a good choice for its ease of use and ability to reconstruct complete Python objects.\n","\n","An alternative is cPickle. It is nearly identical to pickle, but written in C, which makes it up to 1000 times faster. For small files, however, you won't notice the difference in speed.

If you forget the b, a TypeError: must be str, not bytes will be returned. Please note, a simple character in a string may need be represented using one to four bytes (Python 3 uses unicode encoding). Similarly, if skipping **b** from rb when opening the file for reading, you will see error message because some bytes do not belong to the encoding used in Python and thus can not be decoded properly. \n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"t56A9nsE5fEp","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":85},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1585723480597,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":340,"user":{"displayName":"Yongning Tang","photoUrl":"","userId":"15267084954923866581"}},"outputId":"6f081873-3c1d-4420-8ef5-c849363011a6"},"source":["import pickle\n","\n","stuRecord_dict = {'Alice': 90, 'Bob' : 88, 'Cindy':98}\n","\n","print('The original data is:')\n","print(stuRecord_dict)\n","\n","filename = 'stuRecord'\n","outputFile = open(filename,'wb')\n","\n","pickle.dump(stuRecord_dict, outputFile)\n","outputFile.close()\n","\n","infile = open(filename,'rb')\n","new_dict = pickle.load(infile)\n","infile.close()\n","\n","print('The unpickled data is:')\n","print(new_dict)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["The original data is:\n","{'Alice': 90, 'Bob': 88, 'Cindy': 98}\n","The unpickled data is:\n","{'Alice': 90, 'Bob': 88, 'Cindy': 98}\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"MUM9gxako55p"},"source":["##Shelve Module\n","\n","The pickle module is for serializing multiple objects as a single bytestream in a file.\n","\n","Shelve is a python module, built on top of pickle and implements a serialization dictionary where objects are pickled, but associated with a key (some string). You can load your shelved data file and access your pickled objects via keys. This could be more convenient when you need to serialize multiple objects. The shelve module can be used as a simple persistent storage option for Python objects when a relational database is overkill. The shelf is accessed by keys, just as with a dictionary.\n","\n","###Using shelve\n","\n","In the following example, we use shelve.open() to open a  file that takes dictionary style (key:value) input data, where each key is chosen by a user to refer to a pickled object. Yes, shelve uses pickle to serilize objects. In this example, we create four objects (three lists and one dictionary) called stu_list, ex1_list, ex2_list, and stuRecord_dict. Then, we store the four objects into the shelf file (called shelfFile), each with different key, namely, stu, ex1, ex2, stuRec.  Later on, we can retrieve specific object with the corresponding key. \n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"9jcsGWprs7Yq","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":102},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1586794248055,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":1123,"user":{"displayName":"Yongning Tang","photoUrl":"","userId":"15267084954923866581"}},"outputId":"45768a0d-645f-4906-8f11-37ae037d9453"},"source":["import shelve\n","\n","shelfFile = shelve.open('mydata')\n","\n","print(type(shelfFile))\n","\n","stu_list = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Cindy']\n","ex1_list = [80, 70, 90]\n","ex2_list = [90, 80, 100]\n","stuRecord_dict = {'Alice': 90, 'Bob' : 88, 'Cindy':98} \n","\n","shelfFile['stu'] = stu_list\n","shelfFile['ex1'] = ex1_list\n","shelfFile['ex2'] = ex2_list\n","shelfFile['stuRec'] = stuRecord_dict\n","\n","shelfFile.close()\n","\n","shelfFile = shelve.open('mydata')\n","\n","print(shelfFile['stu'])\n","print(shelfFile['ex1'])\n","print(shelfFile['ex2'])\n","print(shelfFile['stuRec'])\n","\n","shelfFile.close()\n","\n"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["<class 'shelve.DbfilenameShelf'>\n","['Alice', 'Bob', 'Cindy']\n","[80, 70, 90]\n","[90, 80, 100]\n","{'Alice': 90, 'Bob': 88, 'Cindy': 98}\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"9OgxKG_wU3Ok","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":34},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1586795033064,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":975,"user":{"displayName":"Yongning Tang","photoUrl":"","userId":"15267084954923866581"}},"outputId":"9e24ee6d-afa8-4480-9e16-316c7e00e941"},"source":["s1 = 'Tom'\n","s2 = '10.1.1.1'\n","':'.join([s1, s2])"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["'Tom:10.1.1.1'"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":6}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"Kvmm6sQ9WQHf","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":34},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1586794948284,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":543,"user":{"displayName":"Yongning Tang","photoUrl":"","userId":"15267084954923866581"}},"outputId":"3c0e98f1-9ad1-40a0-eea4-bd85f3600b53"},"source":["'#'.join(['cats', 'rats', 'bats'])"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["'cats#rats#bats'"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":4}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"CUMbAUvPvAUo"},"source":[""]}]}
